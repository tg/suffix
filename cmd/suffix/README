suffix -- domain name suffix search and print

Suffix tool scans input lines and tries to locate a column containing name matching
suffix pattern. Suffix matches the name if the latter ends with the same labels
as specified by suffix. Labels are delimited by dots, as in DNS.

For example suffix 'golang.org' would match 'blog.golang.org', but wouldn't
match 'amigolang.org'.

If no input files are provided, lines are read from stdin.
Multiple name patterns can be provided by using -f flag, in which case
no patterns are expected on command line.

All matching is case sensitive.

Usage:
  suffix pattern [file...] [flags]

Flags:
  -c, --column=0: select only one column for matching
  -d, --delimiter="\t": column delimiter
  -f, --file="": read name patterns from file
  -F, --fixed-names[=false]: treat suffixes as FQDNs, so they must match exactly
  -v, --invert-match[=false]: invert match
